## Overview

The evolution of [[ref: Decentralized Identifiers]] ([[ref: DID]]) continues to
be a dynamic area of development in the quest for secure and private digital
identity management. The `did:web` method, praised for its simplicity and ease
of deployment, allows for DIDs to be associated with a domain's reputation or
published on platforms like GitHub. However, it is not without its challenges
from trust layers inherited from the web and the absence of a verifiable history
for the DID. Addressing these concerns, the proposed `did:tdw` (Trust DID Web)
method aims to enhance `did:web` by introducing a verifiable history feature,
akin to what is available with ledger-based DIDs, without relying on a ledger.
This approach not only maintains backward compatibility but also offers an
additional layer of assurance for those requiring more robust verification
processes. By publishing the resulting DID as both `did:web` and `did:tdw`, it
caters to a broader range of trust requirements, from those who are comfortable
with the existing `did:web` infrastructure to those seeking greater security
assurances provided by `did:tdw`. This innovative step represents a significant
stride towards a more trusted and secure web, where the integrity of
cryptographic key publishing is paramount.

The key differences between `did:web` and `did:tdw` revolve around the core
issues of decentralization and security. `did:web` is recognized for its
simplicity and cost-effectiveness, allowing for easy establishment of a
credential ecosystem. However, it is not inherently decentralized as it relies
on DNS domain names, which require centralized registries, and it lacks a
cryptographically verifiable, tamper-resistant, and persistently stored DID
document. In contrast, `did:tdw` (Trust DID Web) is proposed as an enhancement
to `did:web`, aiming to address these limitations by adding a verifiable history
to the DID without the need for a ledger. This method seeks to provide a more
decentralized approach by ensuring that the security of the embedded
self-certifying identifier does not depend on DNS. Additionally, `did:tdw` is
capable of resolving a cryptographically verifiable trust registry and status
lists, using DID-Linked Resources, which `did:web` lacks. These features are
designed to build a trusted web, offering a higher level of assurance for
cryptographic key publishing and management.

For backwards compatibility, and for verifiers that "trust" `did:web`, a
`did:tdw` can be trivially modified and published in parallel to a `did:web`
DID. For resolvers that want more assurance, `did:tdw` provides a way to "trust
did:web" (or to enable a "trusted web" if you say it fast), by supporting these
features:

- Ongoing publishing of all DID Document (DIDDoc) versions for a DID instead of,
  or alongside a `did:web` DID.
- Uses the same DID-to-HTTPS transformations as `did:web`.
- Provides resolvers the full history of the DID using a verifiable chain of
  updates to the DIDDoc from genesis to deactivation.
- A [[def: self-certifying identifier]] (SCID) for the DID that is globally
  unique and derived from the initial DIDDoc, enabling verifiable "alsoKnownAs"
  DIDs.
- DIDDoc updates include a proof signed by the DID Controller(s) authorized to
  update the DID.
- An optional mechanism for publishing "pre-rotation" keys to prevent loss of
  control of the DID in cases where an active private key is compromised.
- DID URL path handling that defaults to automatically resolving a
  `<did>/path/to/file` being retrieved through using a comparable DID-to-HTTPS
  translation as for the DIDDoc.
- A DID URL path `<did>/whois` that defaults to automatically returning a [[ref:
  Verifiable Presentation]] containing [[ref: Verifiable Credentials]] with the
  DID as the `credentialSubject`, signed by the DID.

The following is a `tl;dr` summary of the specification summarizing how
`did:tdw` works.

1. In the same path as where DID resolvers find a `did:web`'s `did.json`,
  `did:tdw`'s `didlog.txt` file is found. The same `did:web` DID-to-HTTPS
  transformation is used.
2. The `didlog.txt` is a list of JSON [[ref: DID log entries]], one per line,
  whitespace removed, each of which contains the information needed to derive a
  version of the DIDDoc from its preceding version.
3. Each entry includes six JSON entries:
    1. A hash of the entry.
    2. The `versionId` of the DIDDoc, starting from 1 and incrementing.
    3. The `versionTime` (as stated by the DID Controller) of the entry.
    4. A set of `parameters` that impact the processing of the current and
      future log entries.
        - Example parameters are the version of the `did:tdw` specification and
        hash algorithm being used.
    5. The new version of the DIDDoc as either a `value` (the full document) or
      a `patch` derived using [[ref: JSON Patch]] to update the new version from
      the previous entry.
    6. A [[ref: Data Integrity]] (DI) proof across the entry, signed by a DID
      Controller authorized to update the DIDDoc.
4. In generating the first version of the DIDDoc, the DID Controller calculates
  the [[ref: SCID]] for the DID, includes it as a `parameter` in the first log
  entry, and inserts it where needed in the initial (and all subsequent)
  DIDDocs.
5. A DID Controller generates and publishes the updated log file by making it
  available at the appropriate location on the web, based on the identifier of the
  DID.
6. Given a `did:tdw` DID, a resolver converts the DID to an HTTPS URL,
  retrieves, and processes the log file `didlog.txt`, generating and verifying
  each log entry as per the requirements outlined in this specification.
    - In the process, the resolvers may collect all the DIDDoc versions and public
      keys (by reference) used by the DID currently, or in the past. This enables
      resolving both current and past DID URLs.
7. `did:tdw` DID URLs with paths and `/whois` are resolved to documents
  published by the DID Controller that are by default in the web location relative to the
  `didlog.txt` file. See the [note below](#the-whois-use-case) about the
   powerful capability enabled by the `/whois` DID URL path.
8. Optionally, a DID Controller can generate and publish a `did:web` DIDDoc
  from the latest `did:tdw` DIDDoc by changing the `id` to the `did:web` DID,
  and adding an `alsoKnownAs` for the `did:tdw` (indicating to a resolver that
  they can verify the DIDDoc, if wanted).

  ::: warning
    A resolver settling for just the `did:web` version of the DID does not get the verifiability
    of the `did:tdw` log.

### The `/whois` Use Case

This DID Method introduces what we hope will be a widely embraced convention for all DID Methods -- the `/whois` path. This feature harkens back to the `WHOIS` protocol that was created in the 1970s to provide a directory about people and entities in the early days of ARPANET. In the 80's, `whois` evolved into a [[spec-inform:rfc920]] that has expanded into the [global whois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS) feature we know today as [[spec-inform:rfc3912]]. Submit a `whois` request about a domain name, and get back the information published about that domain.

We propose that the `/whois` path for a DID enable a comparable, decentralized, version of the `WHOIS` protocol for DIDs. Notably, when `<did>/whois` is resolved (using a standard DID `service` that follows the [[ref: Linked-VP]] specification), a [[ref: Verifiable Presentation]] (VP) may be returned (if published by the DID Controller) containing [[ref: Verifiable Credentials]] with the DID as the `credentialSubject`, and the VP signed by the DID. Given a DID, one can find out who controls that DID by calling `<did>/whois` and processing the returned VP. That's powerful -- a decentralized trust registry. For `did:tdw`, the approach is very simple -- transform the DID to its HTTPS equivalent, and `GET <https>/whois`. Need to know who issued the VCs in the VP? Get the issuer DIDs from the VCs, and resolve `<issuer did>/whois`. This is comparable to walking a CA (Certificate Authority) hierarchy, but self-managed by the DID Controllers -- and the issuers that attest to them.

The following is a use case for the `/whois` capability. Consider an example of the `did:tdw` controller being a mining company that has exported a shipment and created a "Product Passport" Verifiable Credential with information about the shipment. A country importing the shipment (the Importer) might want to know more about the issuer of the VC, and hence, the details of the shipment. They resolve the `<did>/whois` of the entity and get back a Verifiable Presentation about that DID. It might contain:

- A verifiable credential issued by the Legal Entity Registrar for the jurisdiction in which the mining company is headquartered.
  - Since the Importer knows about the Legal Entity Registrar, they can automate this lookup to get more information about the company from the VC -- its legal name, when it was registered, contact information, etc.
- A verifiable credential for a "Mining Permit" issued by the mining authority for the jurisdiction in which the company operates.
  - Perhaps the Importer does not know about the mining authority for that jurisdiction. The Importer can repeat the `/whois` resolution process for the issuer of _that_ credential. The Importer might (for example), resolve and verify the `did:tdw` DID for the Authority, and then resolve the `/whois` DID URL to find a verifiable credential issued by the government of the jurisdiction. The Importer recognizes and trusts that government's authority, and so can decide to recognize and trust the mining permit authority.
- A verifiable credential about the auditing of the mining practices of the mining company. Again, the Importer doesn't know about the issuer of the audit VC, so they resolve the `/whois` for the DID of the issuer, get its VP and find that it is accredited to audit mining companies by the [London Metal Exchange](https://www.lme.com/en/) according to one of its mining standards. As the Importer knows about both the London Metal Exchange and the standard, it can make a trust decision about the original Product Passport Verifiable Credential.

Such checks can all be done with a handful of HTTPS requests and the processing of the DIDs and verifiable presentations. If the system cannot automatically make a trust decision, lots of information has been quickly collected that can be passed to a person to make such a decision.

The result is an efficient, verifiable, credential-based, decentralized, multi-domain trust registry, empowering individuals and organizations to verify the authenticity and legitimacy of DIDs. The convention promotes a decentralized trust model where trust is established through cryptographic verification rather than reliance on centralized authorities. By enabling anyone to access and validate the information associated with a DID, the "/whois" path contributes to the overall security and integrity of decentralized networks.
